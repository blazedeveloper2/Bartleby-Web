/* An exercise with an `alt` names the kit it needs in `req` ('bar', 'wheel').
   Turn that piece of equipment off in Settings and the whole app — rendering,
   scoring, badge counts — reads the `alt` version instead, so
   the program still works for anyone without a pull-up bar or an ab wheel.
   An `alt` with no `req` never swaps; name the equipment.

   A day carrying a `since` date was added to the program on that date.
   Streaks, the heatmap and perfect weeks in rank.js honour it, so the
   weekday reads as what it actually was before then — a rest day — instead
   of a wall of retroactive misses. */
