# Bartleby Web

A personal, local-first suite of small web apps. Each "app" is a self-contained
module; a lightweight shell switches between them from the sidebar.

Live apps:

- **Workout** — 4-day upper/lower program tracker with a muscle-map modal
  (tap an exercise to set its working weight), a bodyweight trend chart, and a
  **Rank** tab: a letter grade (F→SS) computed from your working weights
  against published population strength standards relative to your bodyweight,
  plus a training level that climbs one step per finished session (with a
  level-up card when it does), streaks, a consistency heatmap, milestones and
  a daily verse. The level is attendance only: it never reads a weight, so it
  can't move the letter and the letter can't be farmed by showing up.
  Every weighted lift in the program is scored; each one is tagged with how
  trustworthy its standard is (exact match / proxy movement / estimate).
  See `apps/workout/standards.js` for the data and its sources.
- **Finance** — where the money goes, and how much of it is left.
  **Add / History / Insights** track spending: log by category (add/delete your
  own categories) with a calendar date picker and notes, a filterable history
  with per-day totals and a jump-to-any-day filter, and Insights (category donut
  + jump-to-any month/year + 12-month trend + repeat-note grouping).
  **Net Worth** tracks the total itself: add up everything you hold, subtract
  what you owe, log the number, and repeat whenever you like. One snapshot per
  day, plotted on a real time axis so an interval you took six months to cross
  looks like six months. Negative totals are allowed — the chart draws the zero
  line and colours the trend by direction. Because the expenses live in the same
  app, each gap in the history can also say roughly what came in: the change in
  your total plus what you logged as spent over the same stretch. That figure is
  labelled as the inference it is.
Archived (parked in `archive/`, not loaded by the shell — see
`archive/README.md` to restore):

- **Scripture** — read the Bible with the Church Fathers. **Library** walks the
  canon book by book, or takes a reference in the jump box (`matthew 25`,
  `mt 25:31`, `1cor13`, `ps 23`). Tapping a verse opens it with every patristic
  comment on it, earliest father first, each named with its source work.
  **Saved** keeps the verses you starred, grouped in canon order, with your own
  note. Everything is offline: no key, no API, no network. Its generated KJV
  text and commentary data are archived alongside it.

**Settings** (gear, bottom of the sidebar) holds the theme picker, the
pull-up-bar toggle, and backup.

All data is stored locally in your browser (`localStorage`). Nothing is sent
anywhere. Use **Settings → Export Backup** to save a `.json` file before
switching devices, and **Import Backup** to restore it. Backups cover every
`bp_` (workout), `fin_` (finance) and `bs_` (suite settings, e.g. theme) key.
Scripture's `sc_` keys (stars and notes) stay in the browser untouched while
the app is archived, but drop out of backups until it is restored.

## Themes

`Arcade` (orange game-HUD, animated) is the default; `Midnight` is the original
still blue-grey. A theme is one block of CSS variables plus an optional
animation set — see `assets/css/themes.css` and `assets/js/theme.js`.

### Adding a new app

1. Create `apps/<name>/index.js` that default-exports:
   `{ id, name, icon, styles, mount(root), unmount() }`.
2. Add its CSS at `apps/<name>/<name>.css`.
3. Import it in `assets/js/shell.js` and add it to the `APPS` array.
4. Give it a `storagePrefix` (e.g. `sc_`) in that same default export. The
   shell reads it to include the app in backups and to name its slice in the
   Settings storage breakdown — miss it and the app works fine while its data
   quietly stays out of every backup.

That's it — it shows up as a tab automatically.

## Running locally

**Double-click `start.bat`.** It serves the folder and opens your browser.
Leave the console window open while you use the app.

Do **not** open `index.html` directly — the apps use ES modules, which browsers
refuse to load from a `file://` path, so you'd get a blank page. Any static
server works if you'd rather do it by hand:

```
npx serve .
```

Note that each origin has its own `localStorage`: data you enter on
`localhost` is separate from data on the published GitHub Pages site. Use
Export/Import to move between them.

---

## Publishing online (GitHub Pages)

A one-time setup, then it auto-deploys forever.

**1. Create the repo** (on <https://github.com/new>): name it `bartleby-web`,
keep it Public (Pages is free for public repos), and **don't** add a README —
this folder already has one.

**2. Connect this folder and push** (run once, in this folder):

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/bartleby-web.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**3. Turn on Pages:** repo → **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment →
Source: GitHub Actions**. The included workflow does the rest.

Your site goes live at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/bartleby-web/`

### Syncing changes after that

Just double-click **`sync.bat`** whenever you want to save + publish. It commits
everything and pushes; GitHub rebuilds the site in ~1 minute.

If you'd rather type it, the same thing from a terminal in this folder is:

```
git add -A; git commit -m "describe what you changed"; git push
```

The repo is **blazedeveloper2/Bartleby-Web**. It stays Public because
GitHub Pages on a free account only serves public repos.
